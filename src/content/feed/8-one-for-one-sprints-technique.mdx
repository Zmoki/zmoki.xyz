## The wall of boreeedom &#129393;

My [Day Themes system](/feed/5-day-themes-system/) has been working beautifully for managing my energy and intention. But sometimes, even the best system meets a task that feels like **pure torture**.

Recently, I finished a huge project for a client. All that stood between me and getting paid was writing a stack of **boring** reporting documents for their finance team.

For three days straight, I opened the space where I needed to work on them... and did absolutely nothing. The resistance was physical. My brain violently **rejected** the task. All I wanted to do was work on my &#10024; [digital garden](/feed/2-why-im-building-a-digital-garden/) &#10024;.

This is [executive dysfunction](/feed/4-neurodivergent-glossary/#executive-dysfunction) in its purest form. Knowing you _have_ to do something, needing the outcome (money!), but being utterly _unable_ to start. It feels like hitting an invisible wall.

## Seeking help

I was stuck, so I turned to my AI chat assistant for help (the same one that helped me build my [neurodivergent glossary](/feed/4-neurodivergent-glossary/)). I explained the situation: the boring task, the desperate need to finish it _today_, and the intense craving to work on my creative project instead.

The AI suggested a neurodivergent adaptation of a well-known existing productivity techniques.

### 1-for-1 Sprints technique as a solution

It proposed a technique called **1-for-1 Sprints**. The idea builds on the famous **Pomodoro Technique** (25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest). But for a brain like mine, a simple 5-minute break isn't enough dopamine reward to tackle a truly awful task. So, the 1-for-1 Sprint swaps the short break for an **equal block of high-dopamine reward time**.

It's essentially **Premack's Principle**, or "Grandma's Rule": _You have to eat your vegetables (the boring task) before you get dessert (the reward task)_.

The rules were simple:

1.  Set a timer for **25 minutes**.
2.  Work _only_ on the **boring** task for those 25 minutes. For me it was creating the reports.
3.  When the timer rings, **stop immediately**.
4.  Set another timer for **25 minutes**.
5.  Spend those 25 minutes doing the **high-dopamine** activity. I was excited about working on my digital garden.
6.  Repeat.

## Breaking through

It sounded almost too simple, but grounded in psychology and common in the ADHD community, I decided to try it.

And it _worked_.

The first 25-minute block felt long, but knowing there was a guaranteed reward right after made it bearable. The key was framing the work sprint not as "writing all reports" but as "just type a title". A simple, mechanical task with a clear end point.

And the 25-minute reward block? Pure bliss. I got to dive into my digital garden, guilt-free, knowing I was actually _earning_ that time.

I repeated the cycle. Report. Garden. Report. Garden.

**In less than 3 hours, I finished _all_ the reports.**

## A new tool for my Personal&nbsp;OS

The **1-for-1 Sprint** was all about respecting my brain's needs. It turned a dreaded "push" against the wall into an incentivized "pull" towards a reward, using established psychological principles adapted for my neurotype.

This simple technique is now a proven, repeatable strategy in my 'Personal OS' for handling those high-stakes, low-dopamine tasks that feel impossible. It's a reminder that better negotiation is often the best way to manage [executive dysfunction](/feed/4-neurodivergent-glossary/#executive-dysfunction).
