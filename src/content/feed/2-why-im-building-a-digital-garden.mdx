## Why one box is not enough

For years, I thought about starting a website. The advice was always the same: **'find your niche'**.

Should it be a professional tech blog? An art portfolio? A place for my research? The pressure to choose one box felt paralyzing, because **I am not a niche**.

[I am](/feed/1-about-me/) a software engineer, a contemporary artist, and a [neurodivergent](/feed/4-neurodivergent-glossary/) researcher.

So I decided to build a space that could hold all of it. This approach lets me:

- Follow my curiosity wherever it leads.
- Explore the interesting, cross-pollinating ideas between my different worlds.
- Share my work in a way that feels authentic, with my perspective as the only connecting thread.

## My space for curiosity

A digital garden is simply a website that grows and evolves organically, like a real garden. For me, it's a living **'user manual for my brain'**, where I document my hyper-fixations and creative explorations. It's a space for curiosity.

Here, you'll find things like:

- My guide to [Tbilisi's clothes swap scene](/feed/6-tbilisi-swaps-guide/).
- A [neurodivergent glossary](/feed/4-neurodivergent-glossary/).
- A story of how [nerdy curiosity makes my work better](/feed/7-nerdy-curiosity-better-work/).

## How I embrace the process

What that means is this space is **intentionally imperfect**. It's not about polished, finished articles. It's about the _process_ of learning and connecting in public. I think of it in stages:

- **Seeds:** Half-formed thoughts, new questions, and early concepts.
- **Sprouts:** Notes that are growing as I do more research and connect them to other ideas.
- **Blooms:** More complete, polished pieces of thought and discovery.

The goal is to show the work, the learning, and the connections as they happen.

This is my corner of the web. Welcome &#129655;

## A few quick questions

### What exactly is a digital garden?

It's a personal site that's more about the _process_ of learning than about _publishing_ finished articles. I think of it as a collection of notes, ideas, and links that are constantly growing and connecting.

It's less of a formal blog and more of a living, evolving map of my brain.

### How often will you be posting?

Honestly, I don't have a schedule. As a neurodivergent person, I've learned that forcing a rigid schedule is the fastest way to burn out.

I'll post when I've fallen down a new rabbit hole or have a new system to share. It could be three times a week or once a month, depending on my energy and curiosity.

### How did you build this site?

As a developer, I really wanted to build it myself from scratch. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and all my content is written in Markdown.

The entire project is open-source, and you can see all the code [on my GitHub](https://github.com/zmoki/zmoki.xyz).

### What if I have feedback or want to connect?

That's the best part. This is a two-way conversation. If a post resonates with you or you spot a mistake, I'd genuinely love to hear from you.

The best way to reach me is to send an email to [hey@zmoki.xyz](mailto:hey@zmoki.xyz).
