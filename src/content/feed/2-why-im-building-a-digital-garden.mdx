## Why one box is not enough

For years, I thought about starting a website. The advice was always the same: **'find your niche'**.

Should it be a professional tech blog? An art portfolio? A place for my research? The pressure to choose one box felt paralyzing, because **I am not a niche**.

[I am](/feed/1-about-me/) a software engineer, a contemporary artist, and a neurodivergent researcher.

So I decided to build a space that could hold all of it. This approach lets me:

- Follow my curiosity wherever it leads.
- Explore the interesting, cross-pollinating ideas between my different worlds.
- Share my work in a way that feels authentic, with my perspective as the only connecting thread.

## My space for curiosity

A digital garden is simply a website that grows and evolves organically, like a real garden. For me, it's a living **'user manual for my brain'** and the primary way I explore tech, art, and identity. It's where I document my hyper-fixations and creative explorations. It's a space for curiosity.

Here, you'll find things like:

- My guide to [Tbilisi's clothes swap scene](/feed/6-tbilisi-swaps-guide/).
- A [neurodivergent glossary](/feed/4-neurodivergent-glossary/).
- A story of how [nerdy curiosity makes my work better](/feed/7-nerdy-curiosity-better-work/).

## How I embrace the process

What that means is this space is **intentionally imperfect**. It's not about polished, finished articles. It's about the _process_ of learning and connecting in public. I think of it in stages:

The goal is to show the work, the learning, and the connections as they happen. It's also a low-pressure way for me to practice writing in public. I want to **write and publish a book** someday, and this garden is my training ground.

In addition to posts on the [now](/now/) page, you can see a brief summary of where I am now and what I'm doing.

## A few quick questions

### What exactly is a digital garden?

It's a personal site that's more about the _process_ of learning than about _publishing_ finished articles. I think of it as a collection of notes, ideas, and links that are constantly growing and connecting.

It's less of a formal blog and more of a living, evolving map of my brain.

### How often will you be posting?

Honestly, I don't have a schedule. As a neurodivergent person, I've learned that forcing a rigid schedule is the fastest way to burn out.

I'll post when I've fallen down a new rabbit hole or have a new system to share. It could be three times a week or once a month, depending on my energy and curiosity.

### How did you build this site?

As a developer, I really wanted to build it myself from scratch. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and all my content is written in Markdown.

The entire project is open-source, and you can see all the code [on my GitHub](https://github.com/zmoki/zmoki.xyz).

### What if I have feedback or want to connect?

That's the best part. This is a two-way conversation. If a post resonates with you or you spot a mistake, I'd genuinely love to hear from you.

The best way to reach me is to send an email to [hey@zmoki.xyz](mailto:hey@zmoki.xyz).
