This week, I was looking at the calendar, thinking about the future, and realized something about March 2026.

## A symbolic deadline

My father died on March 8, 2013.

My mother died on March 17, 2019.

In March 2026, it will be exactly **13 years** since my father's passing and **7 years** since my mother's.

13, the number for bad luck. 7, the number for good luck. And 10 days in between.

It felt like a sign. A perfect, symbolic window. I suddenly knew what I had to do. I would have **my next art exhibition then**. It would open on March 8 and close on March 17. It would be an exhibition dedicated to them, and to the small version of me who holds their memories.

For months, I've been thinking about an exhibition for my new series of small paper collages. I've already made over 40 of them, and I've been wanting to show them while I live in Tbilisi. The idea was just an abstract wish until this realization about the March 2026 dates. Suddenly, the poetic realization created a hard, practical deadline.

## Building my exploration tool

The exhibition is in March 2026. This means (as of November 2025) I have about four months to find and secure a gallery.

And here's the challenge: I've lived in Tbilisi for about a year, but I still need to explore the local art scene. My default is to stay inside home, working on my art and tech projects.

To overcome this, I turned to a tool I had already started. I remembered a project I abandoned: **"Where's Art,"** a Notion database I started to catalogue interesting art places around the world. It was dusty and incomplete.

So, I spent the last two days reviving it. I blew off the dust and started adding every Tbilisi-based art institution, gallery, and artist-run space I knew of or could find.

I am still working on the Notion database, but I've already turned it into a public Google Map list.

### My Tbilisi art map

This is the tool I built to push myself to go outside. I'm sharing it with you because I think it's a useful resource for anyone interested in the Tbilisi art scene.

<ResourceLink slug="google-maps-list-tbilisi-art-spaces" />

As of today, this Google Maps list has **23 places**, including a mix of art galleries, museums, and cultural centers. These are all actual, working spaces that I've confirmed hold exhibitions, maybe not every single day, but at least a few times per year.

## The next step

My new plan is to turn this digital map into a real-world journey, one pin at a time. I need to visit these places, meet the people, and find a home for my story and my collages.
