## Where my worlds meet

My name is Zarema Khalilova. For a long time, I treated my identities as separate lives, stored in different boxes. This digital garden is the place where they all meet.

I am a:

- **Software Engineer** with over 20 years of experience.
- **Contemporary Artist and Collector** processing my history and environment.
- **Community Builder** who brings people and ideas together through events and talks.
- **Neurodivergent Researcher** who loves a deep-dive.
- [**Kabardian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabardians).

## Places that shaped me

My story is a map of places. It starts in the industrial city of Norilsk, in the Far North of Russia, under a sky that was mostly grey. My teens were spent in the Caucasus, where I found my first community of creative misfits and started my university journey in computer science.

The largest part of my life was lived in Saint Petersburg. It's where I left university to build a career, where I lost my father and then my mother, and where a stray orange cat named Misha joined my life. He's been my traveling companion ever since.

On the third day of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, I left Russia. First for Cyprus, and now I live in [Tbilisi](/feed/6-tbilisi-swaps-guide/), Georgia. This forced migration was also an awakening. It's how I finally saw the true color of the sky and understood the meaning of freedom.

## My builder side

My career in tech has been a cycle of building, losing, and rebuilding. Here are a few of the milestones:

- I co-founded a web agency that went bankrupt, but from the ashes, I built my first startup, **EventCRM**, a SaaS for event managers, only to lose it after Russia's 2014 occupation of Crimea triggered a banking crisis.
- I reimagined my career, focusing on frontend, and worked with great companies like **Uploadcare, RealAdvisor, 3commas, and Lido**.
- I poured my energy into community, building **SPB Frontend** into the big local meetup and helping launch the **HolyJS** conference.

Now, after all that, I feel the pull again. I want to build my own path.

## My art and collecting

In 2021, I started collecting contemporary art. Inspired by the book _A Poor Collector's Guide to Buying Great Art_ by Erling Kagge, I began my collection by acquiring pieces directly from living artists, galleries, and at art auctions, first focusing on Russian artists, then Cypriot and Greek.

Then, in 2023, I had a realization: **I am an artist, too**.

My debut solo exhibition in Limassol, "Do you love the color of the sky?", was built from high-quality prints of my photographs to materialize my journey from the grey world to the bright one.

Currently, my work is evolving. I'm focusing on more tactile media, creating a series of small collages with paper.

## Why I built this space

This [digital garden](/feed/2-why-im-building-a-digital-garden/) is my solution to the pressure of choosing a niche. It is a home for all of my selves and the space where I actively **explore tech, art, and identity**.

The person who can spend an evening learning to cook Osetian pies is the same person who can learn data analytics in a couple of months (plus one skill, hehe). The person who loves staying in a fancy hotel also knows what it's like to lose everything. The person who wants to learn the Kabardian language of her ancestors is the same person who dreams of returning to Bangkok someday.

This is my corner of the web. I'm glad you're here &#129655;
