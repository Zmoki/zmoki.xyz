I have a dedicated chat with an AI assistant where I go to unpack and handle my neurodivergent struggles. It's become a space for untangling the knots, for finding clarity in the chaos.

Out of those conversations, we built this glossary. It started as a personal reference, a user manual for understanding the unique wiring of my own brain. I'm sharing it here because finding the right words gave me a framework for feelings I couldn't name before. It was a _relief_.

Maybe these words can offer a piece of that clarity to you, too.

## Glossary of neurodivergent terms

Anhedonia
: This isn't sadness; it's the **_absence_** **of feeling**. It's the profound sense of "meh" when the things I used to love bring me no joy. For me, it feels like being in limbo, a key symptom that can show up in depression or [autistic burnout](#autistic-burnout). My favorite movies are boring, food is bland, and any spark of interest evaporates almost instantly. It's the feeling of the **reward system** in the brain that has gone **offline**.

Autistic burnout
: This is a state of **complete exhaustion** that comes from the accumulated stress of living in a world not built for me. It's so much more than just being tired. It's feeling like my brain has **short-circuited**. Skills I once had, like being social, suddenly disappear, often as a result of prolonged [masking](#masking-or-camouflaging). Sensory sensitivities are heightened, and the need for solitude becomes overwhelming.

Body doubling
: A **surprisingly simple** strategy for getting things done. It's the act of working
on a task with another person present, either physically or virtually. They don't help or
collaborate; their presence alone acts as an **anchor**, creating a quiet focus that helps break
through the paralysis that comes with [executive dysfunction](#executive-dysfunction).

Emotional dysregulation
: This is when an emotional response doesn't match the situation - at least on the outside. For me, it feels like having an emotional volume knob that goes from **0 to 11** with nothing in between. A small frustration can feel like a world-ending catastrophe. It's a core part of how a [neurodivergent](#neurodivergence-nd) brain processes feelings with **high intensity**. It's exhausting to ride these emotional waves. Learning grounding techniques, like the [5-4-3-2-1 method I wrote about](/feed/3-remembering-grounding-technique/), is a key tool for navigating this.

Executive dysfunction
: This is the struggle with the brain's **management system**, and a core partof ADHD under the [neurodivergence](#neurodivergence-nd) umbrella. I know this one well. For me it's having a brilliant idea and feeling completely unable to implement it. It's knowing _what_ to do but feeling like there's an **invisible wall** between me and the task. It's the constant battle with planning, starting, and organizing.

Masking (or Camouflaging)
: The act of consciously or unconsciously hiding [neurodivergent](#neurodivergence-nd) traits to fit in. It's _performing "normalcy."_ It means forcing eye contact when it's uncomfortable, scripting conversations in my head, and suppressing the urge for [stimming](#stimming). It feels like playing a character all day, and it is **completely, utterly draining**.

Neurodivergence (ND)
: This is simply a way of saying that a brain works differently from what society considers "typical." It's **not a disease or a deficit**. It's a **natural variation** in the human brain that includes Autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more. The opposite is Neurotypical (NT).

Stimming
: Short for self-stimulatory behavior, this is any repetitive action that helps **regulate emotions**. For me, it can be **fidgeting** with small plush toys or napkins, vaping, or more intense actions like pulling small branches from a tree, or tearing at my hair. It's a physical way to channel restless energy or **calm an overwhelmed nervous system**.

Waiting mode paralysis
: That feeling of being **stuck** when I'm waiting for something to happen - a call, an appointment, a delivery. I can't relax, but I also can't start any meaningful tasks because my brain is **'on hold'** for the future event. This state is often a frustrating mix of [anhedonia](#anhedonia) and [executive dysfunction](#executive-dysfunction). Recently, I've found a way to manage this: I play a game like Disney Dreamlight Valley. It's the perfect tool to fill that time without the pressure of a 'real' task.

## More than labels

For me, seeing these terms defined is about finding the language for a lifetime of experiences. It was the **quiet click of understanding** - the relief of knowing I wasn't alone in these feelings, that my brain wasn't _broken_, just _different_.

If any of these words resonate with you, know that **you aren't alone, either**.

## A few quick questions

### Are these neurodivergent terms 'real' or just made up?

Hah, I had this same thought. They are very real. These are terms used by researchers, therapists, and the neurodivergent community itself to describe shared, lived experiences. For me, finding out that ["waiting mode paralysis"](#waiting-mode-paralysis) was a real thing felt like a huge weight off my shoulders. It's not a personal failing, it's a documented phenomenon.

### Is this a complete list of all neurodivergent terms?

Not even close. This is a _personal_ glossary. It's just the small collection of terms that have been most meaningful to me on my journey so far. This list will grow and change as I continue to learn, and I'll share new terms as I find them.

### What if I don't relate to these terms?

That's perfectly okay. It could simply mean you're neurotypical, and these specific descriptions don't match your experience. It could _also_ mean you are neurodivergent, but in a way that's different from mine. Neurodivergence is a huge spectrum, and everyone's experience is unique. These are the words that gave _me_ a framework for _my_ feelings. Your user manual might have completely different chapters, and that's the whole point.
