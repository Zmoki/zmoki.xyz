  "A welcome post about rejecting the 'niche' and embracing a space for all my interests - from tech
  and art to personal research."

## More Than One Box

For years, I thought about starting a website. The advice was always the same: **'find your
niche'**.

Should it be a professional tech blog? An art portfolio? A place for my research? The pressure to
choose one box felt paralyzing, because **I am not a niche**. I am a frontend developer, a
contemporary artist, and a neurodivergent researcher.

So I decided to build a space that could hold _all of it_.

## A Space for Curiosity

This is my digital garden. Think of it as a living **'user manual for my brain'**, where I document
my hyper-fixations and creative explorations.

One day you might find a list of art galleries in Tbilisi. The next, a post about the River Song
timeline in Doctor Who, a cheat sheet for a grounding technique, or my research into the hEDS, POTS,
and MCAS triad. It's a space for _curiosity_, not for a _brand_.

## Embracing the Process

What that means is this space is **intentionally imperfect**. It's not about polished, finished
articles. It's about the _process_.

Some notes will be seeds, half-formed and just planted. Others might be sprawling, interconnected
branches of thought. The goal is to show the work, the learning, and the connections as they happen.

This is my corner of the web. Welcome &#129655;
