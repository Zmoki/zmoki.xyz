  "A personal glossary of terms that helped me find a framework for my feelings. For anyone
  navigating ADHD, Autism, or just trying to understand their own brain."

I have a dedicated chat with an AI assistant where I go to unpack and handle my neurodivergent
struggles. It's become a space for untangling the knots, for finding clarity in the chaos.

Out of those conversations, we built this glossary. It started as a personal reference, a user
manual for understanding the unique wiring of my own brain. I'm sharing it here because finding the
right words gave me a framework for feelings I couldn't name before. It was a _relief_.

Maybe these words can offer a piece of that clarity to you, too.

## The Glossary

Anhedonia : This isn't sadness; it's the **_absence_** **of feeling**. It's the profound sense of
"meh" when the things you used to love bring you no joy. For me, it feels like being in limbo, a key
symptom that can show up in depression or [autistic burnout](#autistic-burnout). My favorite movies
are boring, food is bland, and any spark of interest evaporates almost instantly. It's the feeling
of the **reward system** in the brain that has gone **offline**.

Autistic Burnout : This is a state of **complete exhaustion** that comes from the accumulated stress
of living in a world not built for you. It's so much more than just being tired. It's feeling like
your brain has **short-circuited**. Skills you once had, like being social, suddenly disappear,
often as a result of prolonged [masking](#masking-or-camouflaging). Sensory sensitivities are
heightened, and the need for solitude becomes overwhelming.

Body Doubling : A **surprisingly simple** strategy for getting things done. It's the act of working
on a task with another person present, either physically or virtually. They don't help or
collaborate; their presence alone acts as an **anchor**, creating a quiet focus that helps break
through the paralysis that comes with [executive dysfunction](#executive-dysfunction).

Executive Dysfunction : This is the struggle with the brain's **management system**, and a core part
of ADHD under the [neurodivergence](#neurodivergence-nd) umbrella. I know this one well. For me,
it's having a brilliant idea and feeling completely unable to implement it. It's knowing _what_ to
do but feeling like there's an **invisible wall** between you and the task. It's the constant battle
with planning, starting, and organizing.

Masking (or Camouflaging) : The act of consciously or unconsciously hiding
[neurodivergent](#neurodivergence-nd) traits to fit in. It's _performing "normalcy."_ It means
forcing eye contact when it's uncomfortable, scripting conversations in your head, and suppressing
the urge for [stimming](#stimming). It feels like playing a character all day, and it is
**completely, utterly draining**.

Neurodivergence (ND) : This is simply a way of saying that a brain works differently from what
society considers "typical." It's **not a disease or a deficit**. It's a **natural variation** in
the human brain that includes Autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more. The opposite is Neurotypical (NT).

Stimming : Short for self-stimulatory behavior, this is any repetitive action that helps **regulate
emotions**. For me, it can be fidgeting with small plush toys or napkins, vaping, or more intense
actions like pulling small branches from a tree, tearing at my hair, or scratching my skin. It's a
physical way to channel restless energy or **calm an overwhelmed nervous system**.

Waiting Mode Paralysis : That feeling of being **stuck** when you're waiting for something to
happen - a call, an appointment, a delivery. You can't relax, but you also can't start any
meaningful tasks because your brain is **'on hold'** for the future event. This state is often a
frustrating mix of [anhedonia](#anhedonia) and [executive dysfunction](#executive-dysfunction).
Recently, I've found a way to manage this: I play a game like Disney Dreamlight Valley. It's the
perfect tool to fill that time without the pressure of a 'real' task.

## More Than Labels

For me, seeing these terms defined isn't about **collecting labels**. It's about finding the
language for a lifetime of experiences. It was the **quiet click of understanding** - the relief of
knowing I wasn't alone in these feelings, that my brain wasn't _broken_, just _different_.

If any of these words resonate with you, know that **you aren't alone, either**.
