## Where I am

I live in Tbilisi, Georgia. Most of the time I'm sitting in my room and don't go outside. It's quite unusual for me, but I have a lot of fun with the interesting things I'm doing.

## Art and creative work

I'm crocheting a panel that will be an art object at my next exhibition. I'm also making other things like a winter hood-hat, iPhone pocket, cat toys, and so on. I found a couple of cool local shops with Turkish yarn. It's a gem.

I'm creating small collages from paper as art pieces. Recently I discovered that I can create a colored shadow with fluorescent acrylic paint. It's awesome.

I finally got a small lightbox for photographing small objects and I'm learning how to make professional photos of my art pieces like small collages.

## This digital garden

I launched [this digital garden](/feed/2-why-im-building-a-digital-garden/) just a few months ago, so I'm continuing to improve the tech part of the website. I have a lot of ideas for future posts. It's great to feel this power that I can finally write and publish my texts.

## Tech work

I made AI agents to work with content in Webflow CMS for my client.

Currently, I'm researching how images really perform in SEO and how to make them right.

## Learning and growth

I'm learning how to manage my neurodivergent traits.

I just figured out the terms "nap attack" and "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown." It describes what's happening with me sometimes when I suddenly feel sleepiness.

## Entertainment and rest

I finished the "Tamagotchi Adventure Kingdom" game and I'm looking for a new one.

I'm watching the TV series "Drop Dead Diva" and rewatching "Harry Potter" films.
