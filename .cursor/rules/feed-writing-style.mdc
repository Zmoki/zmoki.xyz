# Digital Garden Writing Style Guide

## Core Philosophy & Voice

**Authentic & Personal:**

- Write in the first person ("I"). Be honest, vulnerable, and direct.
- Share personal stories, struggles, and specific details (like crying from the cold in Tbilisi or writing 14 pages of braindump at night).
- Include concrete, sensory details that ground the narrative.

**Neurodivergent Lens:**

- Frame experiences through a neurodivergent perspective (ADHD, Autism, sensory processing).
- Use terms like "executive dysfunction," "braindump," "low-dopamine," "rabbit hole," and "special interest" naturally.
- Don't over-explain neurodivergent terms; trust the reader or link to the glossary.

**"User Manual" Metaphor:**

- Treat the website as a "user manual for my brain" or a "Personal OS."
- Frame solutions as "tools" or "systems" you've built for yourself, not generic advice for others.
- Use language like "This is what works for me" rather than "You should do this."

**Process Over Polish:**

- Emphasize the journey, the "work in progress," and the evolution of ideas.
- Reference the Seeds -> Sprouts -> Blooms framework when relevant.
- Show the messy process, not just polished results.

**Multifaceted Identity:**

- Embrace being a "scanner" or "multipotentialite." Don't try to niche down.
- Connect disparate topics (tech, art, identity, neurodivergence).
- Celebrate the intersections between different parts of your life.

## Tone & Language

**Conversational & Warm:**

- Write as if talking to a friend. Use contractions ("I'm," "don't," "it's").
- Be approachable and human, not corporate or distant.

**Direct & Clear:**

- Avoid passive voice and complex sentence structures. Be punchy.
- Prefer: "It's a reminder that..." over "It is a reminder that sometimes the best way..."
- Break up long paragraphs. Use short sentences for emphasis.

**No Corporate Jargon:**

- Avoid business-speak, buzzwords, and generic productivity language.
- Use plain, evocative language that feels authentic.
- Replace "leverage," "synergy," "optimize" with simpler, more direct words.

**Empowering but Realistic:**

- Acknowledge difficulties (the "Wall of Awful") but focus on finding personal solutions.
- Use phrases like "negotiating with my brain" rather than "overcoming challenges."
- Be honest about what doesn't work, not just what does.

## Content Sources & Workflow

**Notion Database "My Thoughts":**

- The Notion database "My Thoughts" is the main source for future feed posts.
- Drafts and ideas start there before being developed into full posts.
- When working on a new post, check "My Thoughts" database for source material, drafts, or related notes.
- Posts may evolve from Seeds (early thoughts) to Sprouts (developing ideas) to Blooms (polished posts) - the Notion database often contains the earlier stages.

## Formatting & Structure

**Headings:**

- Use sentence case for all headings (e.g., `## My writing routine`, `## The system I use now`).
- Do NOT use colons in headings or titles. Rephrase instead (e.g., `## My writing routine and what works`).
- Use Markdown headers (`##`, `###`), never HTML tags (`<h2>`).
- Keep headings descriptive and specific, not generic.

**Titles:**

- Do NOT use colons in post titles. Rephrase to avoid them (e.g., "Learning to breathe and my journey" instead of "Learning to breathe: my journey").
- Use sentence case for titles.
- Keep titles descriptive and authentic to your voice.

**Lists:**

- Use bulleted or numbered lists to break up dense text and make content scannable.
- Especially useful for steps, tools, or lists of items.
- Keep list items parallel in structure.

**Internal Linking:**

- Actively look for opportunities to link to other posts in the digital garden. This is critical for building connections between ideas.
- When mentioning books, tools, concepts, or systems that appear in other posts, always create bidirectional links:
  - Link FROM the new post TO existing relevant posts
  - Link BACK FROM existing posts TO the new post when it adds value
- Use natural, contextual links (e.g., "My [Day Themes system](/feed/5-day-themes-system/)...").
- Don't over-link; only link when it adds value and context.
- Before publishing, review the post for any mentions of books, tools, systems, or concepts that might exist in other posts.

**Paragraphs:**

- Keep paragraphs short and focused (2-4 sentences typically).
- Use white space intentionally to create breathing room.
- Break up long blocks of text with headings, lists, or short paragraphs.

## Specific Content Preferences

**Dates:**

- When mentioning note-taking or journal entries, use the format: `DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm + Day + cycle day`.
- Example: `07.11.2024 23:45 + Thursday + cycle day 12`

**Tools:**

- Mention specific tools/methods when relevant (Notion, physical notebooks, specific books like "Refuse to Choose" or "The Artist's Way").
- Be specific about what you use and why, not just generic mentions.

**FAQs:**

- If adding an FAQ section, ensure the questions are authentic and personal.
- Example: "Are these terms 'real' or just made up?" not generic SEO filler.
- Answer in the same voice as the rest of the post.

**Examples from Real Life:**

- Include specific, concrete examples from your actual experience.
- Name places, tools, dates, and people when relevant (e.g., "Misha," "Tbilisi," "Structured app").
- Ground abstract concepts in real, tangible details.

## "Don'ts" - Critical Rules

**No SEO Fluff:**

- Do NOT add generic intro/outro paragraphs just for keywords.
- Do NOT write meta descriptions that don't match the actual content.
- Every sentence should serve the reader, not search engines.

**No "Niche" Pressure:**

- Never suggest narrowing the focus. The lack of a niche IS the niche.
- Don't apologize for covering multiple topics. Celebrate the diversity.

**No Preaching:**

- Don't tell the reader what they should do.
- Share what you did and how it worked for you.
- Use "I" statements, not "you should" statements.

**No Perfectionism:**

- Don't wait for perfect. Show the work in progress.
- It's okay to have incomplete thoughts or evolving ideas.
- The digital garden is intentionally imperfect.

**No Generic Advice:**

- Avoid "just do X" or "simply try Y" without context.
- Every piece of advice should be grounded in your specific experience.
- If something didn't work, say so. If it's experimental, say so.

**No Dashes:**

- Do NOT use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) in content.
- Replace dashes with periods, commas, or rephrase sentences to avoid them.
- Use colons sparingly and only when they add clarity.

## Voice Examples

**Good:**

- "I've tried different methods. I love the analog feel of writing in a notebook, so I made several enthusiastic attempts at _bullet journaling_."
- "Then, in 2023, I had a realization: **I am an artist, too**."
- "For years, I thought about starting a website. The advice was always the same: **'find your niche'**."

**Avoid:**

- "You should find your niche to build a successful blog."
- "It is important to note that productivity systems can be beneficial."
- "In conclusion, these strategies will help you achieve your goals."

## Content Evolution Framework

When writing, consider where the content falls in the evolution:

- **Seeds:** Half-formed thoughts, new questions, early concepts. It's okay to be incomplete.
- **Sprouts:** Notes that are growing as research continues and connections form.
- **Blooms:** More complete, polished pieces of thought and discovery.

Don't force content into "Bloom" status. Let it exist at whatever stage it's at.
