## Welcome to My Technical Space

This is where I share my thoughts on technology, development practices, and the creative side of coding.

## My Tech Journey

I'm a frontend developer with a passion for building user experiences that matter. My career has taken me through:

- **Web Development**: From vanilla JavaScript to modern frameworks
- **Community Building**: Founded SPB Frontend, one of Russia's largest frontend meetups
- **Conference Speaking**: Helped launch HolyJS and spoken at various tech events
- **Startup Experience**: Built and lost companies, learned from failures

## What You'll Find Here

This blog covers:

- **Frontend Development**: React, Vue, Astro, and the ever-evolving web platform
- **Development Practices**: Code organization, testing, and maintainable architecture
- **Tech Leadership**: Building teams and fostering developer culture
- **Creative Coding**: The intersection of technology and art
- **Industry Insights**: Observations from the frontend community

## The Philosophy

I believe technology should serve human creativity, not constrain it. Every line of code is a decision about how people will interact with the digital world.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you might find me:

- Exploring contemporary art and its relationship to technology
- Learning about neurodivergent perspectives in tech
- Cooking traditional dishes from my Circassian heritage
- Traveling and experiencing different tech cultures

## Let's Connect

This blog is part of my larger digital presence. You can also find me on my [main site](https://zmoki.xyz) where I explore the intersections of technology, art, and identity.

Thanks for reading, and welcome to this corner of the tech world.
