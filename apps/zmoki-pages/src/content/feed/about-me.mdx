## The Intersections

My name is Zarema Khalilova.

I am a software engineer, a contemporary artist, and a [neurodivergent](/feed/neurodivergent-glossary/#neurodivergence-nd) researcher. I am a Kabardian, one of the Circassian tribes. For a long time, I treated these as separate lives, stored in different boxes. This digital garden is the place where they all meet.

## A Geography of the Self

My story is a map of places. It starts in the industrial city of Norilsk, in the Far North of Russia, under a sky that was mostly grey. My teens were spent in the Caucasus, where I found my first community of creative misfits and started my university journey in computer science.

The largest part of my life was lived in Saint Petersburg. It's where I left university to build a career, where I lost my father and then my mother, and where a stray orange cat named Misha joined my life. He's been my traveling companion ever since.

On the third day of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, I left Russia. First for Cyprus, and now I live in Tbilisi, Georgia. This forced migration was also an awakening. It's how I finally saw the true color of the sky and understood the meaning of freedom.

## The Builder

My career in tech has been a cycle of building, losing, and rebuilding.

I co-founded a web agency that, after a few years, went bankrupt. But from the ashes, I built my first startup, a SaaS for event managers, only to lose it after Russia's 2014 occupation of Crimea triggered a banking crisis.

After that, I reimagined my career, focusing on frontend development. I found my footing, eventually becoming a frontend lead. Along the way, I poured my energy into community, building SPB Frontend into the biggest local meetup and helping launch the HolyJS conference. I love bringing people together.

Now, after all that, I feel the pull again. I want to build my own business.

## The Artist and Collector

In 2021, I started collecting contemporary art. First Russian artists, then Cypriot and Greek. Then, in 2023, I had a realization: I am an artist, too. I had my debut solo exhibition in Limassol, "Do you love the color of the sky?", which was my attempt to materialize my journey from the grey world to the bright one.

My creative side is also fed by my special interests. I love the Marvel universe, especially the X-Men. I adore clever detective stories like "Knives Out." And I'm a feminist, always learning and unlearning.

## Why This Space Exists

This [digital garden](/feed/my-first-post/) is my solution to the pressure of choosing a niche. It is a home for all of my selves.

The person who can spend an evening learning to cook Osetian pies from relatives is the same person who can learn data analytics in a few months (plus one skill, hehe). The person who loves staying in a fancy hotel also knows what it's like to lose everything and hope to recover. The person who wants to learn the Kabardian language of her ancestors is the same person who dreams of returning to Bangkok someday.

This is my corner of the web. It is a collection of my process, my discoveries, and my connections. I'm glad you're here.
