## The Cold Awakening

I moved to Tbilisi in May, straight from a Cyprus summer that, it seems, lasts all year. The warmest thing in my wardrobe was a frivolous cotton sweater, perfect for +15Â°C, but, as it turned out, **completely useless** when the city suddenly decided to switch on _'real autumn'_ mode in October. Hah.

I'll admit, I cried from the cold. Just to go outside, I had to wrap myself in three layers of Cypriot optimism.

Naturally, I was complaining about my fate to all my local friends, and one of them suggested, 'Let's go to a swap.' Free used clothes? _Meh_. My mind immediately flashed back to a past life where I'd be leisurely picking out things with a personal stylist. And now I'm supposed to dig through a mountain of someone else's stuff? Oh no.

But late autumn won, and I agreed.

## The First Swap

The swap was at [Easy Art Space](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9cAGUuGCcMziKEs6). A bright, warm loft with big windows. I arrived before my friend, didn't know a soul, but the atmosphere was nothing like I'd imagined. There were girls all around, smiling, chatting, joking. And somehow, I quickly melted. Literally.

Walking up to the table of clothes, I discovered a new world. An hour later, I had a mountain of treasures, including a warm things. But the main thing was, I met a new friend there, a student from Germany. And it was this new friendship, and not the old sweater I found, that **truly warmed me** during that first cold, gloomy Tbilisi winter.

That first swap wasn't just a one-time salvation. It turns out, Tbilisi has a whole, wonderful subculture of swapping, and it's not just about clothes. It's about community, sustainability, and the thrill of the hunt.

## A Guide to the Tbilisi Swap Scene

If you're new to the city or just swap-curious, here are a few of my favorite public-facing spots to get you started.

### Easy Art Space (Vera)

This is the one that started it all for me. The swaps here are fun, and the clothes are consistently the best. It's an evening event, and entry is usually just the price of a drink from their non-alcoholic bar.

**Tip:** You have to keep an eye on their [Telegram channel](https://t.me/easy_art_tbilisi) or [Instagram stories](https://www.instagram.com/easy_art_tbilisi/) for announcements. All leftovers are donated to charity, which is a lovely touch.

### Introvert Coffee Bar (Vake)

For something more predictable on your calendar. This cozy coffee shop ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/introvert.coffee.bar/), [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uhTKwF9nD4QpzxJL9)) hosts swaps every last weekend of the month, for two full days. It's a true treasure hunt: you can find a huge room filled not only with clothes but also art supplies, accessories, books, and home goods. Entry is a 10 GEL donation or just buying a coffee.

### Kvira Space (Saburtalo)

A queer-friendly community coworking space ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kvira_space/)) that sometimes hosts big swap events. The entry is a small donation (usually 10 GEL). Honestly, it might be worth going just for the stunning city view from the 16th floor.

## The Real Treasure

Of course, these three spots are just the beginning. I've learned that the **real heart of Tbilisi's swap scene beats in private Telegram chats**, where most of the events are actually announced.

So, the best advice I can give is this: just go to one. Have a coffee, browse the racks, and chat with people. That's how you find the community and get those invites. It's a world built on personal connections, not just public posts.

Maybe one day I'll add more swap spots. Or maybe not, some treasures are more fun to discover for yourself. Happy hunting!
